# Hi! Iâ€™m Moshraf Hossain 
I am a Data Science graduate from University of Western Sydney, and I also hold a degree in Geology and Information Technology. I am currently working as a GIS Analyst at Shariar GIS School. Before I started work as a GIS Analyst, I had worked nearly 10 years as an Exploration Geologist & Geotech and IT industry which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights. My academic background in data science and statistics provided me with a solid foundation, which I have built upon with hands-on experience in predictive modelling, natural language processing, and deep learning. 

Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.
