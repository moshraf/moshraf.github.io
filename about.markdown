# Hi! I’m Moshraf Hossain 
I am a Data Science graduate from the University of Western Sydney, with additional degrees in Geology and Information Technology. Currently, I work as a GIS Analyst at Shariar GIS School. Prior to this role, I gained nearly 10 years of experience as an Exploration Geologist, Geotech professional, and in the IT industry, equipping me with a unique ability to interpret complex data and translate it into clear, actionable insights. My formal education in data science and statistics has provided a strong technical foundation, which I’ve enhanced through practical experience in predictive modelling, natural language processing, and deep learning.

Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.
