);
```

### **2. Sorting Orders by Date**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE FirstName IS NULL OR LastName IS NULL OR Email IS NULL OR Phone IS NULL;

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone
FROM Customer
WHERE Email IS NOT NULL AND Phone IS NOT NULL;
```

### **4. Analyzing Sales by Month and Year**
**Objective**: Determine the total orders, quantities, and amount by month and year.
```sql
SELECT
    MONTHNAME(CreationDate) AS MonthName,
    YEAR(CreationDate) AS OrderYear,
    MONTH(CreationDate) AS OrderMonth,
    COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
    SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity,
    SUM(TotalDue) AS TotalAmount
FROM Orders
LEFT OUTER JOIN OrderItem
ON Orders.OrderID = OrderItem.OrderID
GROUP BY MonthName, OrderYear, OrderMonth
ORDER BY OrderYear, OrderMonth;
```

### **5. Identifying Discontinued Products**
**Objective**: Find products that are no longer active.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Product
WHERE Status = "DISCONTINUED";
```

### **6. Top Products and Sizes Sold**
**Objective**: Determine the top product sizes sold and the top three items based on quantity.
```sql
SELECT Size, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM OrderItem
LEFT OUTER JOIN Product
ON OrderItem.ProductID = Product.ProductID
GROUP BY Size
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC;

SELECT Variety, Size, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM OrderItem
LEFT OUTER JOIN Product
ON OrderItem.ProductID = Product.ProductID
GROUP BY Product.ProductID
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### **7. Identifying Top Customers and Salespeople**
**Objective**: Identify the top customers and salespeople who made no sales.
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, COUNT(DISTINCT Orders.OrderID) AS TotalOrders, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity, SUM(TotalDue) AS TotalAmount
FROM Orders
LEFT OUTER JOIN OrderItem
ON Orders.OrderID = OrderItem.OrderID
LEFT OUTER JOIN Customer
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID
GROUP BY Customer.CustomerID
ORDER BY TotalAmount DESC;

SELECT Salesperson.SalespersonID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Salesperson
LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Salesperson.SalespersonID = Orders.SalespersonID 
WHERE Orders.SalespersonID IS NULL;
```

### **8. Calculating Repeat Customer Rate**
**Objective**: Calculate the percentage of customers who made more than one purchase.
```sql
WITH Repeat_Customers AS (
  SELECT CustomerID AS Repeat_Cus
  FROM Orders
  GROUP BY CustomerID
  HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 1
)
SELECT 
(COUNT(DISTINCT Repeat_Cus) / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID)) * 100 AS CustomerRepeatRate
FROM Orders
LEFT OUTER JOIN Repeat_Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Repeat_Customers.Repeat_Cus;
```
